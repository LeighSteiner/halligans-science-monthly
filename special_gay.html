Not gay as in "don't be so gay, Andrew, everyone knows Paris is the capital of France". Gay as in "stuff this sock in your mouth and bite, as your man-minge is about to be split by my ham clarinet". Yes, sir. Gays have been around since the beginning of science, although they are not actually very good at it, because they keep waving out the window and not concentrating. If you wave at science, it doesn't wave back; at least not <i>literally</i>.

				<br>		<b>Gayphonical Telemincing</b>

<p>Communicationwise, the 'coo-eee!' sound for gays is vital - it allows two gays to communicate at distances of up to 25 metres. In addition, gays can flare their nostrils to up to three times the straight nostril size - this communicates emotions such as "get her!" or "what's she come as?", and means they can also fit more nobs up their shnoz. Then they put eggs up their massive gay honkers, in the belief that it will attract bodybuilders, who go around plucking eggs from gay nostrils for their early morning egg drinks. 
</p>
<p>Disastrous consequences entailed for Simon Peters, however, when both eggs hatched at once, and the birds started fighting in his brain! A vicious peck to the frontal lobe destroyed the part of Simon's brain that prevented him from putting mustard on his cock and slapping it against live wiring.
</p>
<p>
Simon and the two birds perished.

<b>Be Afraid</b>
<p>
Gays convert straight people at special conventions in the countryside, by rubbing sandpaper tits against their faces. And it's working. In January of 1999, only 10% of men in the United Kingdom were gay. By the beginning of May, over 85% of men and women had gone "that way". We predict that by the year 2001, existing gays will have evolved into a breed of "super-gay", who have wombs, are immune to gunshot and do not cry when cutting onions. By this point, over 120% of all humanity will be gay, and the overspill will spill over into the animal kingdom, making gay ants a very real concern.
</p>
<b>Boiling Water</b>
<p>
Gay ants only require one sequin each, then they are happy; however, when they approach the queen ant with their special gay costume, she will be dazzled, and may lose control of the anthill, which could crash into a tree. There would also be an increase in playground ant taunts, such as;
</P>
<p><i>"You're gay, you're the gaylord. You've had my dad, and he loved it. He went "oo oo I like it from you, gay boy, you do my thing, that is to say, you fuck my anty botty, and I like it loads"</i></p>
<b>Tolerance</b>
<P>
Gay tolerance. Looks good on paper, and tastes good too, to the liberal middle classes. But a little thought on the matter begs me to differ. Think back to the early 1940s - the atrocities of the Nazis could only have taken place with the tolerance of the public. An advert for tolerance? Lip up Fatty, I think not. As the Manic Street Preachers sang - If you tolerate this, then they'll be touching up your children next. They should all be wiped out, like stubborn poos.
</p>
<b>Scooby Dooby Shit Stabber</b>
<p>Cartoon backfanny sex is difficult, because the characters are two dimensional. As soon as a participant goes behind someone else, he effectively doesn't exist. After twenty years of research, the Hanna-Barbera boffins came up with two solutions to the "can't see them doing it enigma" using the characters of Scooby Doo. Firstly, a fairly rigid profile shot would provide an adequate view of entry, if Fred was taking Shaggy on all fours like a dirty cunt.
</P>
<p>
Secondly, if Shaggy were to fuck a ghost, you'd be able to see through it, and watch the spunk pumping through its insubstantial gut. Meanwhile, Thelma and Daphne give each other a sponge bath while Scooby Doo fixes a photocopying machine in his dungarees.</P>
<b>The Science Of Stellar Sex</b>
<p>
No gravity in space - this means that gays will float about, chasing after blobs of jism, like a real life Pac-Man without the ghosts or power pills. But if you don't have the ghosts, then you don't really need the power pills, do you? Ruins the game, really. After a year of such casual and easy blob-gobbling, therefore, space gays will put obstacles in their own way, to spice up the lazy weeks. Fake blobs, tasting of fish, will be put into the spunk chambers, and robots shoot harpoons with unerring accuracy through the hearts of those who have spurned the tit. Realising that perhaps they went too far, panicked research into a power pill just goes to show how little we learn from history.
<p>
In the distant future (about 2097), all animals, without exception,  will be gay, reproductions being occasioned in street-wombs, which will be as common as cash machines are today.</p>
<b>Prehistoric Stool Thievery</b>
		<p>The one thing we don't know about dinosaurs is what colour they were, or whether they indulged in body-art, or drank Lucozade. What we can safely exterpolate from current gay growth rate figures, however, is that several million years BC, minus 2000% of all creatures would have been gay. This would - probably - have manifested itself in a massive denial symptom, and any expression of gayness would have been deeply repressed.</p>
<p>
For example, Stegosaurus evolved his spiny back over millions of years simply to prevent the advances of amorous Pterodactyls. They weren't homophobic - it just wasn't for them. Tyrannousaurus Rex couldn't reach his zipper or do his buttons up with those tiny arms, so this monster tended to walk around wearing no clothes whatsoever. Naturally, this was seen as begging for it in some quarters; an enormous, rippling beast walking around bone starkers! The Pterodactyls would fly deliberately into him, apologise, then go home and wank each other off with the stories of the collision. 
</p>
<p>
This in-fighting threatened for some time to wipe out the dinosaurs. However, they sorted out their problems with a genuine live-and-let-live attitude, with the exception of T-Rex, who it was agreed would eat anything he fucking well liked. They were actually wiped out by exhaustion from aggressive dancing. </p>

A gay special, brought to us by <b>Dr James Log OBE</b> who is himself a <i>real gay</i>. Log became a gay in 1982 in order to further scientific understanding of gayness and continues to work from a sealed gayproof laboratory in Cheshire.
<p><b>HSM</b> would like to take this opportunity to remind our readers that any gayness resulting from this article is a result of highly trained gays working in a controlled environment with pharmaceutical grade gayness. it should not be attempted at home.</p>
