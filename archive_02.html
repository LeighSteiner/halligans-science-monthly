Can you be trusted?
<p>Not by me, by you, you fool. Can you be <i>sure</i> you're really you, and not a shady non-governmental agency with a hidden agenda and probably bad skin, because if cinema is to be believed, at lot of <i>your lot</i> have awful skin; I'd almost feel sorry for <i>your lot</i> with your bad skin and conspiracies, if it wasn't for the fact that as soon as I did, you'd steal my life, my identity, my Sandra Bullock DVDs, you'd consume me in a terrible conspiracy so complex and conspiratorial that even <I>your lot</I> wouldn't have the tiniest bollock of what it was all about.</p>

<p>A wise man once told me, 'Trust no-one'. He also told me 'never listen to Paul Simon' but that just confused me. By the time I'd listened to some Paul Simon it was too late.</p>
<b>Secret Science - is it real?</b>
<p>
It's hard to know, because if you find out, they have you just where they want you. And if you remain in the dark, they have you just where they want you.
</p> 
<p>And then there's the classic mistake of living half in and half out of the darkness. Biozarrely enough that's also exactly where they want you, if my sources are to be trusted. And my sources are <i>on the internet</i>.
<p>Someday a car will pull up, a car you trust. If you are inclined to trust yellow cars, then it will be a yellow car, or it will be near a yellow car pretending to be its friend. Oh yes. And an old friend will roll down the window and say: "hey, haven't seen you in ages, jump in".
</p> 
<p>And you'll get in, and... <i>nothing</i> out of the ordinary will happen. Because that's the way they <i>run</i> things. It's a fine line. we're not talking CIA, NSA, KGB, MI5, Mossad (why can't Mossad stick to 3 letter acronyms? <i>as soon as you ask that question they already have you</i>, that's why), we are talking about things so secret, they will creep in your room and shave your balls while you are asleep. Curtains. Adios. Fin. Abierto. Donde esta la taverna.

So now that you know that they know, how do you <i>know</i> that they know? This puts us in a hyperquandary: If I told you more, you'd know I was nothing more than a pawn on the vast chessboard of lies and deception and then lies about the lies which are about a deception in the first place which has itself been deceived into thinking that lies are lies which means they're true. You think this is a <i>joke</i>? Well you better open your eyes my friend because it <i>is</i> - a joke that is a secret WAR. Shut UP! we're having a secret war!</p> 
<p>And if I told you any less you'd be uninformed, which is even more highly top security dangerous. You fucking <i>amateur</i>.</p>

<p>
Let's put it this way: You live in a world, yes, a world of houses and windows and doors. But there are doors in those doors, and windows in those windows, and sometimes even doors in the windows. And inside the doors in the windows are things tht nobody should see. Because nobody has. These things are so secret people haven't even taken the time to decide if their secret or not, in case they're spotted thinking about it, and every slip is fatal you know. Even gymslips, even a silky tight fitting gymslip... even <i>that</i> can be fatal.
</P>
<p>So you, john q public, live blissfully in this world unaware of what goes on in the doors in the windows. A door for you is just a door, you never think of the windows or doors or doors with windows in them that might be going on beneath - or even <i>above</i> - the surface. But you are just a mild mannered soft slcie of turnip in a big, big stew, and you have about as much connection to who's holding the salt as a drowning man does to a man driving through the car park of a recreational centre last tuesday.

<b>Secret Science - a dark secret history of secret darkness
</b><p>
Sometime towards the end of world war 2, in a secret bunker under Hitler's secret wehrnacht headquarters, in secret, something happened that was to change history forever, but it was a distraction. And here you are, like a <i>fat moron</i>, reading about it, and missing the real facts.
</p>

<p>It was actually somewhere entirley different, and it makes me laugh to see you beleive it was actually in Nazi Germany, ha ha ha tommy englander. But so sweetly ironic that as my revenge I can reveal to you that it was in Nazi Germany after all, and you have been doubly betrayed and tricked by my cunning lingus. Ach, but you have no hope, with your tommy englander stupid mokey's face and laboured breathing, you are an oaf. I would suspect treachery, but you are too stupid and schmutzig. no secrets for you in this paragraph! For you ze war is over.

<b>Leftcenter Adjutant-colonel Terence Trent Halligan</b> leaves behind him a military career so shining that shrouding it in mystery and shadow requires its own department of the MOD. He has spied, spied on spies, spied on spies who were spyingn on him, spied upside down, spied at over eleven miles an hour, spied blind, spied on toast, spied to spy hush hush eye to eye, and even spied on <i>himself</i>.
<p>After leaving the MOD in 1988 he abandoned everything in a quarry and argued his way into a job cooking eggs for nuns. His books are not available anywhere and despite this article being written by him, his existence remains a highly classified secret. he is shown here as a piece of scientific apparatus which is clearly rubbish and not him.</p>
